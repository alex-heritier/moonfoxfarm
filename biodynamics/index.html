        <div class="MAIN_content">
        	<p>Biodynamics is the original organic movement. After the industrial revolution and World War 1, chemical companies were looking for a way to make profit off of their excess nitrogen. The same chemicals that were used to make bombs were sold to farmers along with big industrious promises. At first the crop yield was greater, but within a couple decades, the detriment to the soil, wildlife, and crops were apparent. All of this is still happening today, but thankfully biodynamics and the sustainable local agriculture movement are also growing.</p>
			<br />
            <p>The word biodynamics means “living forces” and it refers to growing plants, raising animals, caring for the land and all that is alive. Rudolph Steiner gave the Agriculture course that led to biodynamics, and spoke of spiritual science as the path to true a higher consciousness. There is spirit in all life (the whole is more than the sum of the parts.) But the parts are there to observe, to see without judgment. At the farm we observe, we work, and we learn keeping a deep recognition and reverence towards the phenomena of nature and spirit in life. The latest science has proven that we are all made of the same material and there isn&apos;t as much difference as we like to think between each other, plants, animals, or minerals. The health of the land and water is crucial to the health of all its inhabitants.</p>
			<br>
            <p>A biodynamic farmer acts more like a conductor to nature&apos;s orchestra rather than a commander to nature&apos;s army. One of the tenets of biodynamics is to create an enclosed system, minimize inputs, find the balance in a particular place and bring the farm as close as possible to a natural ecosystem. At Moon Fox Farm, we save seed, save water, build compost, grow a diversity of crops, and always keep flowers in bloom for the bees and other pollinators. We keep the earth covered by continually planting in small rotations, growing perennials, and cover crop. We do most work by hand (live force) and use a tractor minimally. All creatures including employees are treated with respect and dignity.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The biodynamic farm is managed holistically in the widest sense, taking into consideration everything from the worms in the ground to the stars in the sky. It&apos;s complicated and simple. We aim to coordinate our tasks on the farm whenever possible with the rhythmic influences of the cosmos. We make our own biodynamic preparations on the farm or with the BDANC medicine for the earth.</p>
